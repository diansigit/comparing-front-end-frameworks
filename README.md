# [Comparing Front-End Frameworks][published url]
## Instructor: [Andrew Burgess][instructor url]


There are so many amazing front-end JavaScript frameworks out there, sometimes it can be hard to figure out which one to use! Each framework has it's adherents who will tell you how great it is, but how can we choose between them? Really we need to experiment with each one, to get a feel for how they each work and begin to decide which is the best suited to our own project needs or style of programming.

During the course, we're going to build an address book application with four different front-end frameworks: Backbone, Angular, React and Ember. We'll get a feeling for how each of these these libraries libraries work and how they stack up against one another.

## Source Files Description

This source repository has a folder for the sample code created in each lesson. Each lesson contains one or more Node.js + Express servers, along with a front-end web applicaiton, ready to run and to experiment with. To run the code for a particular lesson, first open that folder and run `bower install && npm install` to download all the front- and back-end dependencies. Then run `node server.js` to launch the server and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
